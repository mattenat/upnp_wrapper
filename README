UpnpWrapper
===============

This plugin is a means of using UPnP to forward a port on your router
to your development server.  I wrote it for testing Facebook
applications in conjunction with a dynamic DNS provider so I could be
confident my router would allow callbacks to my development
application only when I was trying to test the right piece of
software.  As a contractor with many clients, I didn't want the
security risk of forgetting to turn off the forwarding when switching
between applications.

To install:

	script/plugin install git://github.com/mattenat/upnp_wrapper.git
	script/generate upnp_wrapper [for upnp.yml file to customize]

which will setup a:

	RAILS_ROOT/config/upnp.yml

file with sensible defaults.  Feel free to customize for your own needs.

Please think many times over about running this code in any mode besides
development.

This code depends on Dario Meloni's mupnp gem for all the heavy
lifting.  Thanks!  As such, you will need to have that gem mupnp
installed for proper functionality.

Finally, this will only work if you have a router that is configured
to use UPnP (http://www.upnp.org/standardizeddcps/) and isn't already
configured to forward the port otherwise.  You'll also need to ensure
your local machine's firewall isn't blocking access to the port.

NOTE: I wouldn't guarantee that the shutdown code will be called when
Ruby exits if the exit is in a non-graceful manner.  For my purposes,
this is good enough.
